Open source is a powerful way to learn, grow, and contribute.
Choose projects that align with your interests and skill level.
Effective communication and respectful interactions are vital.
Testing your contributions ensures quality and builds trust.
Maintainers play a crucial role in guiding projects.
Contributions go beyond code: documentation, design, and community support are equally valuable.
